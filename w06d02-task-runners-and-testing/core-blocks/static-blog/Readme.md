## Hints

A simple static blog application could be written using `pug`, `stylus` and `es6`.
The tasks involved here could be 
1. Create a public directory which serves `.html` files
2. Compile `pug` files into pure html. Use header, content and footer files and generate full html page which is ready to serve.
3. Compile `stylus` files into pure css. Combine multiple style files into huge monolithic css file.
4. Transpile es6 into es5
5. Extract thumbnails of images
6. Create a file watcher which runs all above tasks whenever the respective files are changed/saved.
